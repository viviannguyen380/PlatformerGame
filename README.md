Created using Java processing
Adds on defeat-able enemies, music, poison and breakable blocks, and 2 levels.

Rules:
The goal is to collect all the coins without losing all your lives.
Use the arrow keys to move left and right, and "a" to jump.
You lose a life and restart at the level you are on if you:
  a. Touch a spider
  b. Fall below the ground
  c. Touch a poison (purple) block
When you collect all the coins in the first area, you will advance to the second.
Brown spiders can be defeated by jumping on top of them. Red spiders cannot be defeated.
Large spiders give you a high jump to collect higher coins if you bounce on them.
Green blocks act as springs to give you a high jump.

The background and music change randomly with each play.
